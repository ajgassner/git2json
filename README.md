# gitline

- This is my quick but very clean approach to get git logs as JSON.
- Existing solutions all break when special characters are in commit messages or author names, this one does not. 
- I don't want to re-implement git or use a re-implementation, the standard git commandline is good enough.

- it is extensible using plugins, so the transformation can be fine tuned to your projects need.
